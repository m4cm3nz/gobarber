# GoBarber

A scheduling app for Barbershops.  
A Concept project, build during the Rocketseat GoStack Bootcamp.  
It uses Node.js, React.js, and React Native, with Typescript.  
It uses DDD, TTD, SOLID, and Clean Code principles and concepts.  
A lot of cool packages in an awesome CSS styled components designed by the Rocketseat Team.  
It goes from user authentication, to manage and list profiles and appointments.  
Here is my implementation following the classes along with the Bootcamp.
